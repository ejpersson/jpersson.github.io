## <a name="rabbel"></a>Rabbel

A client for the XML-based Instant messaging platform [Jabber](http://www.jabber.org), written for Mac OS X/Cocoa and Linux/GNUstep in Objective-C. Designed to be modular and easy to extend with new functionality it relies heavily on plugins providing protocol-specific functionality. This in order to be able to cope with the changes of the Jabber extension protocols.

The main chat window with the good old Cocoa-folder.
